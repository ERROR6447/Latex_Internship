Exam will be conducted by ‘Online’ Mode through MS Teams only.;Each section must be attempted in a separate answer books. The format of answer page is  available on website ‘notice board’.;Write ID No., Name, Course Code, Course Title, Date of Exam, Signature and Page Nos. on each answer page in the ‘title block’ provided in format. ;Students have to upload answer sheet through “pdf file” for both the sections separately in MS Teams within the stipulated time. Students will get additional 20 minutes to upload answer sheet pdf file for each section. Refer the detailed instructions on website ‘notice board’. ;Give the name to each pdf file as: “ID No.\_Course Code\_Section No.\_Date” (For example, 12AB001\_3CD01\_Section\_1\_03.12.20) ;Numbers in the square brackets to the right indicate maximum marks. ;The text just below marks indicates the CO(s) followed by the Bloom’s level of the question, i.e., R: Remember, U: Understand, A: Apply, N: Analyze, E: Evaluate, C: Create

2.1;04;An 8x1 multiplexer has inputs A,B and C connected to the selection inputs S2,S1 and S0 respectively. The data inputs, I0 through I7, are connected as follows:I1=I2=I5=0,I3=I7=1,I4=I0=D and I6=D'.Determine the Boolean Function that the multiplexer implements;;;;
2.1;NULL;***OR OR OR***;;;;
2.1;04;Implement the following function F with the following two-level forms: NANAD-AND,AND-NOR,OR-NAND,NOR-OR//NewLine()//$ F(A,B,C,D)=//Sum("(0,1,2,3,4,8,9,12)")// $;;;;
2.2;06;Design a combinational logic circuit for the following system. The system is a speed-warning device. It receives, on two lines, an indication of the speed limit of the three tracks on Express Highway. There are 3 possible values: 100 kmph, 110 kmph \& 120 kmph. It receives from the automobile, on other two lines, an indication of the speed of the vehicle. There are 4 possible values: under 100 kmph, between 101 kmph \& 110 kmph, between 111 kmph \& 120 kmph and over 120 kmph. It produces two outputs. The first, F, indicates whether the car is going above the speed limit. The second, G, indicates that the car is driven at a “Dangerous speed”. The “Dangerous speed” is defined as either speed is over 120 kmph or more than 10 kmph above the speed limit of the track. (kmph stands for Kilometer Per Hour.);;;;
